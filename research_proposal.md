*briefly the basic knowledges*
* [CHF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_heat_flux)
> critical heat flux (CHF) is the heat flux at which boiling ceases to be an effective form of transferring heat from a solid surface to a liquid.
* HTC
    * $q=h(T_w - T_f)$
    * q means heat flux
    * h represents the proportionally constant called Heat Transfer coefficient 
    * $T_w ,T_f$ represent the temperatures of wall and fluid
    * *<font color='redge'>which I have misunderstood as heat conductivity in heat conduction with multical heat resistance last time, so that i wrote as the Fourier'law, sorry about that</font>*
* factors 
    * Type of nanoparticles
    * concentration of nanoparticles
    * atachment of nanoparticles forming layer on heat transfer surface
    * (and so on)


*Recording the results in the nanofluid pool boiling each condition*
* differences in type of nanoparticles will effect the CHF and HTC
* while boiling , the nanoparticles layer will appear and being a insulation layer between the wall and fluid(that means the HTC change in convection)
* (and so on

**what has been done before**

* accroding to Ren Ning
    * experiment conditions  
    * conclusion
        * at the same concentration of different nanoparticles,HTC($Al_2O_3 > TiO_2 > SiO_2$),CHF($Al_2O_3 < TiO_2 < SiO_2$)
        * at the same type of particle($SiO_2$),the higher concentration is , the higher CHF is ,but the lower HTC is
        * at the same concentration of nanoparticles, HTC and CHF are almost the same in typical nanoparticle
        * with honeycomb, the HTC is enhanced , but CHF become lower.In situation of $SiO_2$, it seems both CHF and HTC have been enhanced. (This conclusion is not very clear , so I think it is a subject i can do research on)

* according to watanabe , the detachment will happen when approaching CHF. and before the CHF, the mass of nanoparticles layer become higher,
so we choose different degrees of HeatFlux before CHF in experiment

* accroding to watanabe , the mass of layer will go up with heat flux increasing before CHF , and also the mass increase with the conclusion in the situation of $SiO_2$

|the CHF and HTC characteristics of nanofluid pool boiling in higher concentration of $SiO_2$ with honeycomb|

**abstract**
> according to Ren Ning , in honeycomb condition with $SiO_2$ 0.5g/L and 0.05g/L , CHF(former > later),HTC(later >= former). I think maybe it is the mass of particle increase with concentration, which causes the thickness\wickability\surface roughness changing. And with nanoparticle layer on honeycomb , the decreasing effect of HTC is not very obvious.

* the nanoparticles in experiment
    * no nanoparticles(water ---- bare surface)
    * $SiO_2$ 
    * $TiO_2$ 
    * $Al_2O_3$ 
    * no nanoparticles & with honeycomb (water&honeycomb)
    * $SiO_2$ & honeycomb 
    * $TiO_2$ & honeycomb
    * $Al_2O_3$ & honeycomb
 
> why choose these
>* $SiO_2$ : As Ren Ning's paper shown that the CHF increase in $SiO_2$ with honeycomb, and according to graphs ,the higher concentration makes CHF higher    
>* $TiO_2$ : As watanabe's paper shown that the atachment of $TiO_2$ layer is the best compared with other two types particle, and physically the conductivity of $TiO_2$ in matel metarials is low. It acts as a comparative experiment
>* $Al_2O_3$ : It can be easy produced , and with a high conductivity in matel materials . and the mass $Al_2O_3$ formed on the surface is irragular with heat flux 
>* Honeycomb :with the same nanoparticle, the honeycomb enhances HTC, but deteriorate CHF in water.

* experiments
    * water (1)with and (2)without honeycomb 
        * boiling ---- to measure the heat flux of (1)and(2) two situations
    * $SiO_2$ (1)with and (2)without honeycomb 
        * boiling, 0.6g/L , 0.8g/L ,1.0g/L(measure the CHF)
        * heatFlux=80% CHF, 0.6g/L , 0.8g/L ,1.0g/L
        * heatFlux=50% CHF, 0.6g/L ,0.8g/L ,1.0g/L
        * heatFlux=25% CHF, 0.6g/L ,0.8g/L ,1.0g/L
    * $Al_2O_3$ (1)with and (2)without honeycomb 
        * boiling, 0.6g/L (measure the CHF)
        * heatFlux=80% CHF, 0.6g/L
        * heatFlux=50% CHF, 0.6g/L
        * heatFlux=25% CHF, 0.6g/L
    * $TiO_2$ (1)with and (2)without honeycomb 
        * boiling, 0.6g/L (measure the CHF)
        * heatFlux=80% CHF, 0.6g/L
        * heatFlux=50% CHF, 0.6g/L
        * heatFlux=25% CHF, 0.6g/L

* consider carefully about the concentration effects 
> why:
> * 0.6g/L : choose higher than concentration in Ren Ning's experiments
> * 0.8g/L , 1.0 g/L $SiO_2$ : try to do experiment in interval as 0.2g/L

* further
    * expected result : 
        * the higher input heat flux is , the higher mass of layer is 
        * the higher concentration of $SiO_2$(with honeycomb), the higher the CHF is . 
        * the higher concentration of $SiO_2$(with honeycomb), the lower the HTC is.
        * 

**measurement**
* $\Delta T = (T_w - T_f)$
* the roughness , thickness and total mass of nanoparticles layers ($Sa,T,M_0$) depending on Heat Flux
* Wickability rate Heat Flux
$Wi=\frac{V_0\rho_l}{\rho_v^{1/2}[\sigma g(\rho_l - \rho_v)]^{1/4}}$
